        <p>
          As a second-year undergraduate student at the Informatics Institute of
          Technology, I have cultivated a strong foundation in software
          development, web development, and machine learning. My ambition is to
          leverage this knowledge in real-world projects, offering innovative
          solutions. My proficiency lies in Java, JavaScript, and React,
          alongside a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms.
          Additionally, I have gained experience in backend development using
          Node.js frameworks such as Express and NestJS, with aspirations to
          delve deeper into these areas moving forward.

          Looking ahead to 2024, I am excited to explore the realm of mobile app
          development and to expand my proficiency in cutting-edge technologies
          used in the industry. My journey is fueled by a passion for new
          challenges and a commitment to continuous learning and improvement. By
          embracing the latest trends and technologies, I am committed to
          continuous learning and growth, eagerly taking on opportunities that
          allow me to expand my expertise and make a significant impact in the
          field.
